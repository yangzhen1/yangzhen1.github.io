    <p>Hi, This is Zhen Yang and this is my about page. </p>
    <p>With three years of programming learning experience in Rose-Hulman, I realized that I am a perfectionist that never satisfied with the status quo and never settle for the anything but the best. In the Arcade Game project, I collaborated with other two students to conceive, program and execute a consummate arcade game. Everytime I found a new way of improving efficiency or reducing coupling, I would do it no matter of what it costs. Although, it was arduous during the process, the praise and applause at the end of our presentation told me itâ€™s totally worth it. During this game development, I also gained experience and confidence across a diverse spectrum of game developing and date structure through data extracting and reporting functionalities.</p> 
    <p>Diligent but balancing schoolwork, along with a positive attitude towards my dream , has provided me valuable lessons about efficiency and balancing. In my school days, I like to study really hard, get up at 7 and sleep at 12 stick to my schedule, studying time is longer than 13 hours everyday. However, in returns, I have my weekends totally spared. I accompolish other meaningful commitments without worrying about time and unfinished school work at all.</p>
